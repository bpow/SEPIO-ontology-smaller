# SEPIO-ontology

***NOTICE:*** THE SEPIO ONTOLOGY IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVLEOPMENT, AS NEW REQUIREMENTS EMERGE AND THE MODEL IS ITERATIVLY REFINED. IN PARTICULAR WE ARE EXPLORING ALIGNMENT WITH AND RE-USE OF EXISTING STANDARDS.  WE WELCOME ANY FEEDBACK YOU MAY HAVE, IN THE FORM OF USE CASES, EXEMPLAR DATA, AND REQUIREMENTS. PLEASE SUBIT TO OUR TRACKER [HERE](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/SEPIO-ontology/issues).

The **Scientific Evidence and Provenance Information Ontology (SEPIO)** is being developed to support description of evidence and provenance information for scientific claims, with a focus on those found in curated research databases. Use cases driving SEPIO development include integration of scientific claims and their associated evidence/provenance metadata, and support for discovery, analysis, and evaluation of claims based on this metadata. 

In the SEPIO framework, ***evidence*** is defined as information as used to evaluate the validity of a proposition.  Evidence is treated as an entity separate from the particular data that support it, and is generated through the act of interpretation and evaluation of such data as they pertain to the validity of a particular proposition.  ***Provenance*** is the process history leading to a claim being made, including processes through which evidence is evaluated, and processes through which  information used as evidence is created. Provenance metadata includes accounts of who conducted these processes, what entities participated in them, and when/where they occurred. 

The core of the SEPIO model is set of related informational entities representing **propositions**, **assertions**, **evidence lines**, and **supporting data**.  These concepts are commonly referenced, implicitly or explicitly, across various formal models related to evidence and provenance for scientific claims [1,2,3,4], and are rooted in philosophical accounts of reasoning, argument, and discourse. Around these concepts, SEPIO provides a minimal but extensible model of process and process participants that are necessary to address its driving use cases and requirements (Figure 1 below). 

The following **Wiki pages** provide additional information about the SEPIO ontology and its support for structuring evidence and provenance metadata around scientific claims.

SEPIO provides a generic and extensible model that is capable of supporting rich but efficient descriptions of the evidence and provenance behind scientific claims.

_**Figure 1**: Nodes represent core SEPIO types and give examples of each are shown in italics. Information artifacts are outlined in green, processes in orange, and process participants in blue. Cardinalities are indicated for each relationship in the model. A given **proposition** can be expressed in one or more **assertions**. **Assertions** generated by **assertion processes** performed by particular **agents** at particular locations and times, often as specified in formal **assertion protocols**. The **assertion process** also generates one or more **lines of evidence**, as a result of the agent's interpretation of **supporting data** as evidence for or against a **proposition**. **Supporting data** is generated through **data generating processes**, performed by particular **agents** at particular locations and times, using various types of **resources**, and applying various types of **techniques**._
